Wow!  Shocked again!$Kids like you  shouldn't be+here!
Did you come to  explore too?
Losing  stinks!$I came down here  to show off to+girls.
Wow! It's way  bigger in here+than I thought!
Oh!  I lost it!$How do you get  out of here?
What! Don't sneak  up on me!
My  POKéMON won't do!$I have to find  stronger POKéMON.
What? I'm waiting  for my friends to+find me here.
I lost?$I heard there are  some very rare+fossils here.
Suspicious men  are in the cave.+What about you?
You  got me!$I saw them! I'm  sure they're from+TEAM ROCKET!
Go through this  cave to get to+CERULEAN CITY!
I  lost.$ZUBAT is tough!  But, it can be+useful if you+catch one.
Beware! ZUBAT is  a blood sucker!

You want the  DOME FOSSIL?
You want the  HELIX FOSSIL?
A1 got the  !Look, you've got  no room for this.Hey, stop!*I found these  fossils! They're+both mine!
OK!  I'll share!$We'll each take  one!+No being greedy!
Far away, on  CINNABAR ISLAND,+there's a POKéMON+LAB.*They do research  on regenerating+fossils.
All right. Then  this is mine!TEAM ROCKET will  find the fossils,+revive and sell+them for cash!
Urgh!  Now I'm mad!$You made me mad!  TEAM ROCKET will+blacklist you!
We, TEAM ROCKET,  are POKéMON+gangsters!
I blew  it!$Darn it all! My  associates won't+stand for this!
We're pulling a  big job here!+Get lost, kid!
So, you  are good.$If you find a  fossil, give it+to me and scram!
Little kids  should leave+grown-ups alone!
I'm  steamed!$POKéMON lived  here long before+people came.
Bonjour!  I am le waiter on+this ship!*I will be happy  to serve you any-+thing you please!*Ah! Le strong  silent type!
The passengers  are restless!*You might be  challenged by the+more bored ones!
This ship, she is  a luxury liner+for trainers!*At every port, we  hold parties with+invited trainers!
A2: Bonjour!  A1!*Imagine seeing  you here!*A1, were you  really invited?*So how's your  POKéDEX coming?*I already caught  40 kinds, pal!*Different kinds  are everywhere!*Crawl around in  grassy areas!
Humph!*At least you're  raising your+POKéMON!$A1! What are  you, seasick?*You should shape  up, pal!$A2: I heard  there was a CUT+master on board.*But, he was just a  seasick, old man!*But, CUT itself is  really useful!*You should go see  him! Smell ya!
Our CAPTAIN is a  sword master!*He even teaches  CUT to POKéMON!
The party's over.  The ship will be+departing soon.
Scrubbing decks  is hard work!
Urf. I feel ill.*I stepped out to  get some air.
Hey matey!*Let's do a little  jig!
You're  impressive!$How many kinds of  POKéMON do you+think there are?
Ahoy there!  Are you seasick?
I was  just careless!$My Pa said there  are 100 kinds of+POKéMON. I think+there are more.
You, mon petit!  We're busy here!+Out of the way!
I saw an odd ball  in the trash.
I'm so busy I'm  getting dizzy!

Humph!  You rude child!$I wish to be left  alone! Get out!
I love POKéMON!  Do you?
Wow!   You're great!$Let me be your  friend, OK?*Then we can trade  POKéMON!
I collected these  POKéMON from all+around the world!
Oh no!  I went around the+world for these!$You hurt my poor  worldly POKéMON!*I demand that you  heal them at a+POKéMON CENTER!
Waiter, I would  like a cherry pie+please!
A cruise is so  elegant yet cozy!
I always travel  with WIGGLYTUFF!
We are cruising  around the world.
Ssh! I'm a GLOBAL  POLICE agent!*I'm on the trail  of TEAM ROCKET!
In all my travels  I've never seen+any POKéMON sleep+like this one!*It was something  like this!$Ah yes, I have  seen some POKéMON+ferry people+across the water!
POKéMON can CUT  down small bushes.
Have you gone to  the SAFARI ZONE+in FUCHSIA CITY?*It had many rare  kinds of POKéMON!!
Me and my Daddy  think the SAFARI+ZONE is awesome!
The CAPTAIN looked  really sick and+pale!
I hear many people  get seasick!
Competing against  the young keeps+me youthful.
Good  fight! Ah, I feel+young again!$15 years ago, I  would have won!
Check out what I  fished up!
I'm  all out!$Party?*The cruise ship's  party should be+over by now.
Which do you like,  a strong or a+rare POKéMON?
I must  salute you!$I prefer strong  and rare POKéMON.
I never saw you  at the party.
Take  it easy!$Oh, I adore your  strong POKéMON!
MACHOKE: Gwoh!  Goggoh!You know what they  say about sailors+and fighting!
Right!  Good fight, mate!$Haha! Want to be  a sailor, mate?
My sailor's pride  is at stake!
Your  spirit sank me!$Did you see the  FISHING GURU in+VERMILION CITY?
Us sailors have  POKéMON too!

I like feisty  kids like you!Argh!  Lost it!$Sea POKéMON live  in deep water.+You'll need a ROD!
Matey, you're  walking the plank+if you lose!
Argh!  Beaten by a kid!$Jellyfish some-  times drift into+the ship.
Hello stranger!  Stop and chat!*All my POKéMON  are from the sea!
Darn!  I let that one+get away!$I was going to  make you my+assistant too!
My buddy, MACHOKE,  is super strong!*He has enough  STRENGTH to move+big rocks!
I heard rumors of  a child prodigy!
The  rumors were true!$You beat GIOVANNI  of TEAM ROCKET?
I'll show you just  how good you are!
I'm  furious!$You showed me just  how good I was!
Only the chosen  can pass here!
I  don't believe it!$All trainers here  are headed to the+POKéMON LEAGUE!+Be careful!
Trainers live to  seek stronger+opponents!

Why...?Who are you? How  did you get here?

You broke into  our operation?
Burnt!$You're not going  to get away with+this, brat!
Intruder alert!
I  can't do it!$SILPH SCOPE?  I don't know+where it is!

Oof!  Taken down!$SILPH SCOPE?  The machine the+BOSS stole. It's+here somewhere.
We got word from  upstairs that you+were coming!
What?  I lost? No!$Go ahead and go!  But, you need the+LIFT KEY to run+the elevator!
So! I must say, I  am impressed you+got here!
WHAT!  This cannot be!$I see that you  raise POKéMON+with utmost care.*A child like you  would never+understand what I+hope to achieve.*I shall step  aside this time!*I hope we meet  again...
I know you! You  ruined our plans+at MT.MOON!
Burned  again!$Do you have  something against+TEAM ROCKET?
How can you not  see the beauty of+our evil?
Ayaya!$BOSS! I'm sorry I  failed you!
The elevator  doesn't work? Who+has the LIFT KEY?

It appears to  need a key.Eeek!  No! Stop! Help!*Oh, you're not  with TEAM ROCKET.+I thought...+I'm sorry. Here,+please take this!$A1 got  !TM36 is  SELFDESTRUCT!*It's powerful, but  the POKéMON that+uses it faints!+Be careful.
You don't have any  room for this.
Help! I'm a SILPH  employee.
How  did you know I+was a ROCKET?$I work for both  SILPH and TEAM+ROCKET!
It's off limits  here! Go home!
You're  good.$Can you solve the  maze in here?
No kids are  allowed in here!

I work for SILPH.  What should I do?
A1! You and  your POKéMON+saved us!
Quit messing with  us, kid!
I give  up!$A hint? You can  open doors with a+CARD KEY!
I support TEAM  ROCKET more than+I support SILPH!
You  really got me!$Humph...*TEAM ROCKET said  that if I helped+them, they'd let+me study POKéMON!
Sssh! Can't you  see I'm hiding?
Huh? TEAM ROCKET  is gone?
TEAM ROCKET has  taken command of+SILPH CO.!
Arrgh!$Fwahahaha!  My BOSS has been+after this place!
My POKéMON are my  loyal soldiers!
Darn!  You weak POKéMON!$The doors are  electronically+locked! A CARD+KEY opens them!
Intruder spotted!
Who  are you?$I better tell the  BOSS on 11F!
TEAM ROCKET is  in an uproar over+some intruder.+That's you right?
TEAM ROCKET took  off! You're our+hero! Thank you!
I heard a kid was  wandering around.
Boom!$It's not smart  to pick a fight+with TEAM ROCKET!
We study POKé  BALL technology+on this floor!
Dang!  Blast it!$We worked on the  ultimate POKé+BALL which would+catch anything!
Whaaat? There  shouldn't be any+children here?
Isthe  Itradedyouany+stronger?

Well, better get  back to work!
Oh dear, oh dear.  Help me please!
We got engaged!  Heheh!
Look at him! He's  such a coward!
I feel so sorry  for him, I have+to marry him!
TEAM ROCKET is  trying to conquer+the world with+POKéMON!
TEAM ROCKET ran  because of you!
They must have  targeted SILPH+for our POKéMON+products.
Come work for  SILPH when you+get older!
I am one of the 4  ROCKET BROTHERS!
Flame  out!$No matter!  My brothers will+avenge me!
That rotten  PRESIDENT!*He shouldn't have  sent me to the+TIKSI BRANCH!
Shoot!$TIKSI BRANCH?  It's in Russian+no man's land!
You dare betray  TEAM ROCKET?
You  traitor!$If you stand for  justice, you+betray evil!
Oh! Hi! You're  not a ROCKET! You+came to save us?+Why, thank you!*I want you to  have this POKéMON+for saving us.$It's LAPRAS. It's  very intelligent.*We kept it in our  lab, but it will+be much better+off with you!*I think you will  be a good trainer+for LAPRAS!*It's a good  swimmer. It'll+give you a lift!
TEAM ROCKET's  BOSS went to the+boardroom! Is our+PRESIDENT OK?
Saved at last!  Thank you!
TEAM ROCKET was  after the MASTER+BALL which will+catch any POKéMON!
We canceled the  MASTER BALL+project because+of TEAM ROCKET.
It would be bad  if TEAM ROCKET+took over SILPH+or our POKéMON!
Wow! You chased  off TEAM ROCKET+all by yourself?
You! It's really  dangerous here!+You came to save+me? You can't!
Safe at last!  Oh thank you!
Oh ho! I smell a  little rat!
Lights  out!$You won't find my  BOSS by just+scurrying around!

Aack!  Brothers, I lost!$Doesn't matter.  My brothers will+repay the favor!
A child intruder?  That must be you!
Fine!  I lost!$Go on home  before my BOSS+gets ticked off!
A2: What  kept you A1?
A2: Hahaha!  I thought you'd+turn up if I+waited here!*I guess TEAM  ROCKET slowed you+down! Not that I+care!*I saw you in  SAFFRON, so I+decided to see if+you got better!
Oh ho!  So, you are ready+for BOSS ROCKET!$A2: How can  I put this?*You're not good  enough to play+with us big boys!$Well, A1!*I'm moving on up  and ahead!*By checking my  POKéDEX, I'm+starting to see+what's strong and+how they evolve!*I'm going to the  POKéMON LEAGUE+to boot out the+ELITE FOUR!*I'll become the  world's most+powerful trainer!*A1, well  good luck to you!+Don't sweat it!+Smell ya!
I wonder if SILPH  is finished...
Thanks for saving  us!
That's as far as  you'll go!
Not  enough grit!$If you don't turn  back, I'll call+for backup!
You're causing us  problems!
Huh?  I lost?$So, what do you  think of SILPH+BUILDING's maze?
I am one of the 4  ROCKET BROTHERS!
Whoo!  Oh brothers!$I'll leave you up  to my brothers!
You look tired!  You should take a+quick nap!$Don't give up!
Thank you so  much!
Your POKéMON seem  to adore you, kid!

A1 received  TM27!*TM27 is FISSURE!  It will take out+POKéMON with just+one hit!*I made it when I  ran the GYM here,+too long ago...
You do not have  space for this!
Heh! You must be  running out of+steam by now!
I  ran out of gas!$You need power to  keep up with our+GYM LEADER!
Rrrroar! I'm  working myself+into a rage!
Wargh!$I'm still not  worthy!
POKéMON and I, we  make wonderful+music together!
You are in  perfect harmony!$Do you know the  identity of our+GYM LEADER?
Karate is the  ultimate form of+martial arts!
Atcho!$If my POKéMON  were as good at+Karate as I...
The truly talented  win with style!
I  lost my grip!$The LEADER will  scold me!
I'm the KARATE  KING! Your fate+rests with me!
Ayah!$POKéMON LEAGUE?  You? Don't get+cocky!
Your POKéMON will  cower at the+crack of my whip!
Yowch!  Whiplash!$Wait! I was just  careless!
VIRIDIAN GYM was  closed for a long+time, but now our+LEADER is back!
I  was beaten?$You can go onto  POKéMON LEAGUE+only by defeating+our GYM LEADER!
Yo! Champ in  making!*Even I don't know  VIRIDIAN LEADER's+identity!*This will be the  toughest of all+the GYM LEADERs!*I heard that the  trainers here+like ground-type+POKéMON!
Blow me away!  GIOVANNI was the+GYM LEADER here?
Come again!
It's ¥50 for a  child's ticket.*Would you like to  come in?
Right, ¥50!  Thank you!
You don't have  enough money.$You can't sneak  in the back way!*Oh, whatever!  Do you know what+AMBER is?
There's a lab  somewhere trying+to resurrect+ancient POKéMON+from AMBER.
AMBER is fossil-  ized tree sap.
Please go to the  other side!
Take plenty of  time to look!
Ssh! I think that  this chunk of+AMBER contains+POKéMON DNA!*It would be great  if POKéMON could+be resurrected+from it!*But, my colleagues  just ignore me!*So I have a favor  to ask!*Take this to a  POKéMON LAB and+get it examined!$A1 received  OLD AMBER!Ssh! Get the OLD  AMBER checked!
You don't have  space for this!
We are proud of 2  fossils of very+rare, prehistoric+POKéMON!
The AMBER is  clear and gold!
MOON STONE?*What's so special  about it?
July 20, 1969!*The 1st lunar  landing!*I bought a color  TV to watch it!
We have a space  exhibit now.
I want a PIKACHU!  It's so cute!*I asked my Daddy  to catch me one!
Yeah, a PIKACHU  soon, I promise!
SPACE SHUTTLE  COLUMBIA
Meteorite that  fell on MT.MOON.+(MOON STONE?)
I'm BROCK!  I'm PEWTER's GYM+LEADER!*I believe in rock  hard defense and+determination!*That's why my  POKéMON are all+the rock-type!*Do you still want  to challenge me?+Fine then! Show+me your best!
Thanks heavens!*I never thought I  would ever see+the dragon god's+bones!
It's a map of  KANTO!...*It would be great  if she gave it to+me, right?
A2: Heh, I'm  an adult so I+don't need to+be greedy like+you!*Go ahead and  choose first,+A1!
A2: What did  you call me for?
There are all  kinds of trainers+in the world!*You appear to be  very gifted as a+POKéMON trainer!*Go to the GYM in  CERULEAN and test+your abilities!
Wait! Take this  with you!
A1 received  TM34!*A TM contains a  technique that+can be taught to+POKéMON!*A TM is good only  once! So when you+use one to teach+a new technique,+pick the POKéMON+carefully!*TM34 contains  BIDE!*Your POKéMON will  absorb damage in+battle then pay+it back double!
You don't have  room for this!
I took  you for granted.*As proof of your  victory, here's+the BOULDERBADGE!*A1 received  the BOULDERBADGE!*That's an official  POKéMON LEAGUE+BADGE!*Its bearer's  POKéMON become+more powerful!*The technique  FLASH can now be+used any time!$Stop right there,  kid!*You're still light  years from facing+BROCK!
Darn!*Light years isn't  time! It measures+distance!$You're pretty hot,  but not as hot+as BROCK!
Hiya! I can tell  you have what it+takes to become a+POKéMON champ!*I'm no trainer,  but I can tell+you how to win!*Let me take you  to the top!
All right! Let's  get happening!$The 1st POKéMON  out in a match is+at the top of the+POKéMON LIST!*By changing the  order of POKéMON,+matches could be+made easier!
It's a free  service! Let's+get happening!$Just as I thought!  You're POKéMON+champ material!
NIDORAN: Bowbow!NIDORAN sit!
Our POKéMON's an  outsider, so it's+hard to handle.*An outsider is a  POKéMON that you+get in a trade.*It grows fast, but  it may ignore an+unskilled trainer+in battle!*If only we had  some BADGEs...
A shady, old man  got me to buy+this really weird+fish POKéMON!*It's totally weak  and it cost ¥500!
Good things can  happen if you+raise POKéMON+diligently, even+the weak ones!
POKéMON learn new  techniques as+they grow!*But, some moves  must be taught by+the trainer!
POKéMON become  easier to catch+when they are+hurt or asleep!*But, it's not a  sure thing!
What!?*TEAM ROCKET is  at MT.MOON? Huh?+I'm on the phone!*Scram!
JIGGLYPUFF: Puu  pupuu!
Those miserable  ROCKETs!*Look what they  did here!*They stole a TM  for teaching+POKéMON how to+DIG holes!*That cost me a  bundle, it did!
I figure what's  lost is lost!*I decided to teach  DIGLETT how to+DIG without a TM!
TEAM ROCKET must  be trying to DIG+their way into no+good!
TEAM ROCKET left  a way out!
My husband likes  trading POKéMON.*If you are a  collector, would+you please trade+with him?
That BILL!*I heard that  he'll do whatever+it takes to get+rare POKéMON!
Have you heard  about BILL?*Everyone calls  him a POKéMANIAC!*I think people  are just jealous+of BILL, though.*Who wouldn't want  to boast about+their POKéMON?
Hi, you're a new  face!*Trainers who want  to turn pro have+to have a policy+about POKéMON!*What is your  approach when you+catch POKéMON?*My policy is an  all-out offensive+with water-type+POKéMON!
TM11 teaches  BUBBLEBEAM!*Use it on an  aquatic POKéMON!
The CASCADEBADGE  makes all POKéMON+up to L30 obey!*That includes  even outsiders!*There's more, you  can now use CUT+any time!*You can CUT down  small bushes to+open new paths!*You can also have  my favorite TM!
A1 received  TM11!You better make  room for this!
Wow!  You're too much!*All right!*You can have the  CASCADEBADGE to+show you beat me!I'm more than good  enough for you!*MISTY can wait!
You  overwhelmed me!$You have to face  other trainers to+find out how good+you really are.
Splash!*I'm first up!  Let's do it!
That  can't be!$MISTY is going to  keep improving!*She won't lose to  someone like you!
Yo! Champ in  making!*Here's my advice!*The LEADER, MISTY,  is a pro who uses+water POKéMON!*You can drain all  their water with+plant POKéMON!*Or, zap them with  electricity!
You beat MISTY!  What'd I tell ya?*You and me kid,  we make a pretty+darn good team!
Hi! Welcome to  MIRACLE-CYCLE.*Have we got just  the BIKE for you!$It's a cool BIKE!  Do you want it?
Sorry! You can't  afford it!$Oh, that's...*A BIKE VOUCHER!*OK! Here you go!$A1 exchanged  the BIKE VOUCHER+for a BICYCLE.Come back again  some time!
How do you like  your new BICYCLE?*You can take it  on CYCLING ROAD+and in caves!
You better make  room for this!
A plain city BIKE  is good enough+for me!*You can't put a  shopping basket+on an MTB!
These BIKEs are  cool, but they're+way expensive!
Wow. Your BIKE is  really cool!
Use REPEL to keep  bugs and weak+POKéMON away.*Put your strongest  POKéMON at the+top of the list+for best results!
Have you seen any  RARE CANDY?*It's supposed to  make POKéMON go+up one level!
POKéMON BADGEs  are owned only by+skilled trainers.*I see you have  at least one.*Those BADGEs have  amazing secrets!$Now then...*Which of the 8  BADGEs should I+describe?
Come visit me any  time you wish.
The ATTACK of all  POKéMON increases+a little bit.*It also lets you  use FLASH any+time you desire.$POKéMON up to L30  will obey you.*Any higher, they  become unruly!*It also lets you  use CUT outside+of battle.$The SPEED of all  POKéMON increases+a little bit.*It also lets you  use FLY outside+of battle.$POKéMON up to L50  will obey you.*Any higher, they  become unruly!*It also lets you  use STRENGTH out-+side of battle.$The DEFENSE of all  POKéMON increases+a little bit.*It also lets you  use SURF outside+of battle.$POKéMON up to L70  will obey you.*Any higher, they  become unruly!$Your POKéMON's  SPECIAL abilities+increase a bit.$All POKéMON will  obey you!$TEAM ROCKET will  do anything for+the sake of gold!
I saw CUBONE's  mother die trying+to escape from+TEAM ROCKET!
POKéMON TOWER was  erected in the+memory of POKéMON+that had died.
Did you come to  pay respects?+Bless you!
I came to pray  for my CLEFAIRY.*Sniff! I can't  stop crying...
My GROWLITHE...  Why did you die?
I am a CHANNELER!  There are spirits+up to mischief!
A2: Hey,  A1! What+brings you here?+Your POKéMON+don't look dead!*I can at least  make them faint!+Let's go, pal!
What?  You stinker!*I took it easy on  you too!$A2: Well,  look at all your+wimpy POKéMON!*Toughen them up a  bit more!$How's your POKéDEX  coming, pal?+I just caught a+CUBONE!*I can't find the  grown-up MAROWAK+yet!*I doubt there are  any left! Well, I+better get going!+I've got a lot to+accomplish, pal!*Smell ya later!
Even we could not  identify the+wayward GHOSTs!*A SILPH SCOPE  might be able to+unmask them.
Urrg...Awaa...  Huhu...graa..
Hwa!  I'm saved!$The GHOSTs can be  identified by the+SILPH SCOPE.
Kekeke....  Kwaaah!
Hmm?  What am I doing?$Sorry! I was  possessed!
Be gone!  Evil spirit!
Whew!  The spirit left!$My friends were  possessed too!
GHOST! No!  Kwaaah!
Where  is the GHOST?$I must have been  dreaming...
Be cursed with  me! Kwaaah!
What!$We can't crack  the identity of+the GHOSTs.
Huhuhu...  Beat me not!
Huh?  Who? What?$May the departed  souls of POKéMON+rest in peace...
Come, child! I  sealed this space+with white magic!*You can rest here!
Give...me...  your...soul...
Gasp!$I was under  possession!
You...shall...  join...us...
What  a nightmare!$I was possessed!
Zombies!
Ha?$I regained my  senses!
Urgah...  Urff....
Whoo!$I fell to evil  spirits despite+my training!
Entered purified,  protected zone!*A1's POKéMON  are fully healed!
The GHOST was the  restless soul of+CUBONE's mother!
The mother's soul  was calmed.*It departed to  the afterlife!
Give...me...  blood...
Groan!$I feel anemic and  weak...
Urff... Kwaah!
Some-  thing fell out!$Hair didn't fall  out! It was an+evil spirit!
Ke..ke...ke...  ke..ke...ke!!
Keee!$What's going on  here?
Be gone...  Intruders...
MR.FUJI: Heh? You  came to save me?*Thank you. But, I  came here of my+own free will.*I came to calm  the soul of+CUBONE's mother.*I think MAROWAK's  spirit has gone+to the afterlife.*I must thank you  for your kind+concern!*Follow me to my  home, POKéMON+HOUSE at the foot+of this tower.
What do you want?  Why are you here?
I give up!$I'm not going to  forget this!
This old guy came  and complained+about us harming+useless POKéMON!*We're talking it  over as adults!
Please!  No more!$POKéMON are only  good for making+money!*Stay out of our  business!
You're not saving  anyone, kid!
Don't  fight us ROCKETs!$You're not getting  away with this!
That's odd, MR.FUJI  isn't here.+Where'd he go?
MR.FUJI had been  praying alone for+CUBONE's mother.
This is really  MR.FUJI's house.*He's really kind!*He looks after  abandoned and+orphaned POKéMON!
It's so warm!  POKéMON are so+nice to hug!
PSYDUCK: Gwappa!NIDORINO: Gaoo!MR.FUJI: A1.*Your POKéDEX quest  may fail without+love for your+POKéMON.*I think this may  help your quest.$A1 received  a !*Upon hearing POKé  FLUTE, sleeping+POKéMON will+spring awake.*It works on all  sleeping POKéMON.
You must make  room for this!
MR.FUJI: Has my  FLUTE helped you?

I'm searching for  items that raise+the abilities of+POKéMON during a+single battle.*X ATTACK, X  DEFEND, X SPEED+and X SPECIAL are+what I'm after.*Do you know where  I can get them?
You know REVIVE?  It revives any+fainted POKéMON!
I found a NUGGET  in the mountains.*I thought it was  useless, but it+sold for ¥5000!
CUBONE: Kyarugoo!I hate those  horrible ROCKETs!*That poor CUBONE's  mother...*It was killed  trying to escape+from TEAM ROCKET!
The GHOST of  POKéMON TOWER is+gone!*Someone must have  soothed its+restless soul!
Hello, hello!  I am the official+NAME RATER!*Want me to rate  the nicknames of+your POKéMON?
Which POKéMON  should I look at?$, is it?  That is a decent+nickname!*But, would you  like me to give+it a nicer name?*How about it?
Fine! What should  we name it?$OK! This POKéMON  has been renamed+!*That's a better  name than before!
Fine! Come any  time you like!
, is it?  That is a truly+impeccable name!*Take good care of  !
Even if they are  the same level,+POKéMON can have+very different+abilities.*A POKéMON raised  by a trainer is+stronger than one+in the wild.
My POKéMON was  poisoned! It+fainted while we+were walking!
Won't you admire  my PIKACHU's+adorable tail?
Humph! My PIKACHU  is twice as cute+as that one!
I just love my  SEEL!*It squeals when I  hug it!
Oh dear!*My SEEL is far  more attractive!
PIKACHU: Chu!  Pikachu!

Oh. Come back  when you want to+hear my story!
Hello, A1!*Did you come see  me about my+POKéMON again?*No? Too bad!
Make room for  this!
Our Chairman is  very vocal about+POKéMON.
Let's all listen  politely to other+trainers!
If someone brags,  brag right back!
There are evil  people who will+use POKéMON for+criminal acts.*TEAM ROCKET  traffics in rare+POKéMON.*They also abandon  POKéMON that they+consider not to+be popular or+useful.
I think POKéMON  can be good or+evil. It depends+on the trainer.
Hey, kid! What do  you think you're+doing here?*You won't live  long in combat!+That's for sure!*I tell you kid,  electric POKéMON+saved me during+the war!*They zapped my  enemies into+paralysis!*The same as I'll  do to you!
A little word of  advice, kid!*Electricity is  sure powerful!*But, it's useless  against ground-+type POKéMON!
The THUNDERBADGE  cranks up your+POKéMON's SPEED!*It also lets your  POKéMON FLY any+time, kid!*You're special,  kid! Take this!

This is no place  for kids!
Wow!  Surprised me!$LT.SURGE set up  double locks!+Here's a hint!*When you open the  1st lock, the 2nd+lock is right+next to it!

When afflicted by  TOXIC, POKéMON+suffer more and+more as battle+progresses!*It will surely  terrorize foes!

Stop right there!*Our invisible  walls have you+frustrated?
Whoa!  He's got it!$You impressed me!  Here's a hint!*Look very closely  for gaps in the+invisible walls!
I also study the  way of the ninja+with master KOGA!*Ninja have a long  history of using+animals!
Awoo!$I still have much  to learn!
Master KOGA comes  from a long line+of ninjas!*What did you  descend from?
Dropped  my balls!$Where there is  light, there is+shadow!*Light and shadow!  Which do you+choose?
Yo! Champ in  making!*FUCHSIA GYM is  riddled with+invisible walls!*KOGA might appear  close, but he's+blocked off!*You have to find  gaps in the walls+to reach him!
It's amazing how  ninja can terrify+even now!

I was a thief, but  I became straight+as a trainer!
I  surrender!$I can't help  stealing other+people's POKéMON!

I just like using  fire POKéMON!
Too hot  to handle!$I wish there was  a thief POKéMON!+I'd use that!
I know why BLAINE  became a trainer!

Yowza!  Too hot!$Us fire POKéMON  fans like PONYTA+and NINETALES!
Fire is weak  against H2O!
Oh!  Snuffed out!$Water beats fire!  But, fire melts+ice POKéMON!
