The three($49)heads respectively($4E)represent joy, an-($4E)ger, and sadness($5F)($50)($00)It is always out-($4E)rageously furious.($4E)If it gives chase,($49)it will track the($4E)target no matter($4E)how far it goes($5F)($50)($00)In battle, it digs($4E)through the ground($4E)and strikes the($49)unsuspecting foe($4E)from an unexpected($4E)direction($5F)($50)($00)The wings are cov-($4E)ered in dustlike($4E)scales. Every time($49)it flaps its wings($4E)it looses highly($4E)toxic dust($5F)($50)($00)It is covered with($4E)a pure white fur.($4E)The colder the($49)weather, the more($4E)active it becomes($4E)from it($5F)($50)($00)It is covered with($4E)a green skin.

The($4E)shell opens only($4E)when it attacks($5F)($50)($00)It explodes in($4E)response to even($4E)minor stimuli.
