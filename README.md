# Pokémon Red, Green, and Blue

pokejp serves as a dissassembly base, based on the Japanese releases of the Generation 1 Pokémon games.

It builds the following ROMs:

* Pokemon Red.gb 
* Pokemon Green.gb 
* Pokemon Blue.gb 

## Setting up your own

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).

## Why make this?

In 1996, The original Pocket Monsters Red and Green were released. Later that Year, Pocket Monsters Blue was released as well. In the west, 2 years later, Pokémon Red and Blue werre released, using the updated Pocket Monsters Blue as the base engine. A Pokémon game with Pocket Monsters Blue's wild data was never released in Japan. This caused a multitude of changes in the International releases of Red and Blue. This ROM hack serves to create English Versions of those Japanese releases, without including the game breaking glitches in those games.

## What's changed?

* Any bugs present in the original Red and Green that are not in the International Red and Blue are not present.
* The title screen of Pokemon Red and Green has been changed to the original Japanese release.
* Pokémon Blue's wild Pokémon data has been edited to the Japanese release. Pokémon Green uses US Blue's wild data.
* Pokémon Red and Green now use the original Cerulean Cave layout.
* Pokémon Red and Green use their Overworld and Pokémon graphics from their original release.
* Pokémon Green loads its unique Super Game Boy Palette.
* Fixed Glitch where Haunters from in-game trades wouldn't evolve.

## To-do

* Add translated Red and Green Pokédex entries, Most likely edited from the ones in FireRed(?)
* Fix MissingNo. not having the correct graphics, if possible. This could potentially also fix MissingNo. corrupting Hall of Fame data.
